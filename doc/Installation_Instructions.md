If you don’t have a Docker Desktop, , you can download here:

 Docker Desktop may require security policy permissions/changes, depending upon your organization’s current security ecosystem.

## 2. Download, extract, and run the AIR Tool container from GitHub.

In Docker Desktop, open the Terminal by clicking on that button at the bottom right of the window.
