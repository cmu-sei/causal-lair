# Scenario Definition Worksheet 

This worksheet can be used to collaboratively gather information needed for application of the AIR tool to test for model robustness in a scenario of interest. Prompts to help with discussion are provided in italicized text.


## Scenario Summary

Describe the scenario of interest. Include the cause and effect you are interested in as part of the scenario


**Impact**
> *Describe why this scenario provides valuable insight, drives decision making, etc.*


**Experimental (X) Variable**

Variable Label:

Definition of Baseline Values:

Definition of  Experimental Values:


**Outcome (Y) Variable**

Variable Label:

Definition of Success:


## Scenario Data


**Data Selection:**

> *Describe selection of training data, deployment data, or other data source, and impact on value of AIR results.*


**Feature Engineering Required:**

> *Describe known feature engineering required within the dataset.*


**Completeness of Causal Data:**

> *Describe if the dataset contains all variables with causal impact on the scenario, or any known omissions from the dataset.*


**Known Causal Hierarchies:**

> *Confirm that SMEs have provided a rough logical hierarchy of causation between variables, noting any outstanding concerns or questions.*


## Scenario Model


**Model Input to AIR:**

> *Consider tool options: Upload model into AIR, Input model Average Treatment Effect (ATE) value, Allow AIR to create model*
   

**Version of Model:**

> *Describe version, owner, training of model under test for robustness.*


**Model ATE:**

> *Capture Average Treatment Effect for this scenario as generated by the model, if known.*


## Additional Notes

> *Describe any other important information to understanding and analyzing this scenario.*


## Results 

> *Describe the results of analyzing the scenario (e.g., no bias found, bias found but too small to make changes now, bias large enough to require model updates).*


## Issues

> Describe any issues or questions encountered during scenario preparation, and possible resolutions.
