> Scenario Definition Worksheet

This worksheet can be used to collaboratively gather information needed
for application of the AIR tool to test for model robustness in a
scenario of interest.

Scenario Summary

*Describe the scenario of interest. Include the cause and effect you are
interested in as part of the scenario.*

Impact

*Describe why this scenario provides valuable insight, drives decision
making, etc.*

|                         |     |     |
|-------------------------|-----|-----|
| Experimental Variable   |     |     |
| Variable Label          |     |     |
| Definition of Treatment |     |     |
| Outcome Variable        |     |     |
| Variable Label          |     |     |
| Definition of Success   |     |     |

*Note: If more than one variable is to be tested, create the table above
for each variable of interest*

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| Scenario Data |  |  |
| Data Selection | *Describe selection of training data, deployment data, or other data source, and impact on value of AIR results.* |  |
| Feature Engineering Required | *Describe known feature engineering required within the dataset* |  |
| Completeness of Causal Data | *Describe if the dataset contains all variables with causal impact on the scenario, or any known omissions from the dataset.* |  |
| Known Causal Hierarchies | *Confirm that SMEs have provided a rough logical hierarchy of causation between variables, noting any outstanding concerns or questions.* |  |

Additional Notes

*Describe any other important information to understanding and analyzing
this scenario.*

Results

*Describe the results of analyzing the scenario (e.g., no bias found,
bias found but too small to make changes now, bias large enough to
require model updates).*

Issues

*Describe any issues or questions encountered during scenario
preparation, and possible resolutions.*
